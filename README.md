###### Overview:
Murder on the Feathered Express is a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' style role-play game
that is very loosely based off of Agatha Christie's famous murder-mystery novel.

The user takes on the role of a fellow DuckRacer turned detective after several DuckRacers mysteriously go missing. 
Upon beginning the game the user starts with 3 chances and is prompted to select one of three different story lines. 
Each storyline is unique and is revealed piece by piece as the user correctly answers Java trivia questions. 
Each incorrect answer decrements their chances by 1. If the user runs out of chances before finishing the game, they lose. 
At the conclusion of the game the score board is updated so the user can see who has previously won or lost the game.

Enjoy and happy hunting!
